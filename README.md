# Burger Time

# About

This app uses mySQL, Node, Express, and Express-Handlebars to create a restaurant app. The user orders a burger--which is stored in the database. The user can then "pick up" the burger from the counter and "discard" it to delete it from the database.

# Dependencies

This app requires mySQL, Express, Express-Handlebars, and several NPM packages.

# Future Development

This app will be further developed to include more menu items, improve user expreience, and incorporate some other new features.
